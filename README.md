# COVID-19 Classification on X-ray images using Multimodal CNN's

------

### About

This project was made with the objective of making detection of COVID-19 in patients easier and faster. The project was build in Python 3, using the concept of multimodal CNN's. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) was also designed to allow smooth usage. The GUI was designed using the ```PySimpleGUI``` module in Python.

### Requirements

Before running the project, you will need to install certain modules. To do this, type the following command in terminal:

```console

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

------

### How to Run?

Code file: ```covid_main.py```. <br> After successfully installing the requirements, type:

```console

python3 covid_main.py

```
On successful execution, a GUI window pops up. The user is required to choose an X-Ray image as input. The classifier will predict if the patient is positive/negative.
